# Can Stabilizer
The Can Stabilizer is a 3D printed aid that helps stabilize a beverage can. This version of the device is intended for standard 211 cans with a diameter of 66Â mm (e.g., 355 mL / 12 Oz). The stabilizer makes it easier for those with limited hand dexterity to open the can or form a secure grip with less chance of the can spilling over.
